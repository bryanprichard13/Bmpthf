I plan on attending the Value Working group

My Thoughts on the podcast

1) I enjoyed the feel of the podcast and the open table vibe it gave.
2) The fact that the podcast was a platform for professionals in the industry with real working experience when it came to
open source code allowed me to really take what was said to heart.
3) The fact that working towards open source software has been going on for over 8 years as stated around the 5 minute mark
really blew me away as I did not know that this had been a project for the industry for so long.
4) Around the 23 minute mark when they began discussing the different methods and metrics in use by the industry when it came
to tackling this problem and how the different groups took a variety of different paths towards the same goal was an eye opener
as it gives scale to the need of Open Source Software.

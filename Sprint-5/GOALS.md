The purpose of my application will be to check for a valid login and then allow access based on that data. Inside the application it will
be a basic hello world program with a textbox where you can say hello to the server. My core audience is programmers who are getting
started in SSO style programming and want to learn more, or see a basic example template that they could base a project of their own
on. The application will not be sending or recieving data as I am designing it to be a template piece.

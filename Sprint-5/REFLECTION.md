SSO is very much a new and difficult concept to grasp and truly understand. I was eventually able to get the program copied to my google,
and I was beginnig to follow the steps needed to create my own app. However, I was unable to get my app started due to my confusion on
the beginnig steps on how to create and eventually alter an app template to create our own personalized application. I went to the Google
Oauth Home Page, Realpython.com, the Flask Home Page, and I went on youtube to search for video tutorials. Nothing I did worked and I
was getting both hangups in Git Bash and weird errors. By the end of the semester I hope to have at least a finished basic app that
I can be proud of, to show that I understand the material.

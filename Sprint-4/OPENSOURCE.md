The articles I read were very for the idea of participating in an Open Source Software effort. Of the given reasons used by the first
article, all of them seem valid to me as a motivation to participate in Open Source but the most likely is probably money.

After reading these articles, my opinion is that it would be an interesting and fulfilling experience to participate in some large 
format Open Source Project and it would be something that I could put on my resume and be proud of.

I would use the 3-Clause BSD because it is a generic protection copyright that allows others to use my software without them being
able to use my name and the copyright also says that any software taken from me to be used in another way must include the copyright
information at the top. This seems like a short and simple copyright that does not do a whole lot extra, but it does everything I want
it to do.

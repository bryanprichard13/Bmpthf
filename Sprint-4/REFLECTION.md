CS4320 Sprint 4

I looked at Sail and Hydra when trying to decide which SSO I would use. I ended up selecting Sail because it looked to be the easiest and
most well made of the two. When creating my SSO I did not make it very far and was unable to make a working version of a sail file. I was
able to open the sail project on localhost:1337 and I was able to see that my Sail App was there. One of the obstacles I encountered was
a lack of knowledge when it comes to Sail.
